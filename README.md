# Data science docs

In this repo, we write some basic documents and codes for data science

## To visualize the documents
All the docs are written in Markdown format. You can view them directly from the github pages.

If you want to use a search engine or render the docs in a static website. We also provide a build which uses
the [mkdocs](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs/) to generate a static website.

```shell
# get the source
git clone the repo
cd /path/to/repo

# install mkdocs  
pip install mkdocs

# show the website
mkdocs serve
```

All the configuration of the website is in `mkdocs.yml`. You can change it to custom the website.
