# Introduction of machine learning


## General steps in machine learning model development

1. Identify the problem (objective of your model): Classification, regression, clustering
2. Choose an appropriate model algorithm which can solve your problem (e.g. random forest, linear regression, etc.)
3. Prepare the training data, validation data, and test data. (70% Train | 15% Validation | 15% Test) or (80% Train | 20% Test).
4. Train the model
5. Make prediction on validation or test data
6. Evaluate the Model
7. Tune the model (e.g. feature engineering, tune hyperparameters)
8. Check for Overfitting/Underfitting (High train, low test accuracy → Overfitting, Low accuracy on both → Underfitting)
9. Repeat 3,4,5,6,7,9 until you have acceptable model
10. Document and publish (Record metrics, model version, parameters)
11. Continuous training (Try new algorithms, features, preprocessing)
